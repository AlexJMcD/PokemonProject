# PokemonProject

In this project I constructed a Pokedex app.

The app allows the user to search within the Pokedex for specific Pokemon, and allows the user to press a specific Pokemon
to enter its details page.

The app was made using Kotlin, Jetpack compose for the layout, Retrofit for handling network requests, coil for image loading, daggerhilt for dependency injection
and palette for extracting color values from images.

This project was alot of fun and a great learning expereince.
